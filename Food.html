			<h1>Food</h1>

                Cooking is a new-found passion of mine. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Having to cook for my family for an entire summer introduced me to the culinary arts. Although I still have a lot to learn, I love to connect with my culture through the preparations of Chinese cuisine ( with some bacon of course).
