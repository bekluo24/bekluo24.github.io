     Examination of the Mechanical and Phase Properties of the Refractory High Entropy Alloy ReMoNbTaV
    </h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Examined the mechanical and phase properties of ReMoNbTaV, a REHA with three refractory elements: Niobium (Nb), Tantalum (Ta), and Vanadium (V). The properties will be studies using the Small Sets of Ordered Structures (SSOS) method due to its computational efficiency for high-order alloys</p>

     Implementation of Canopy Height Values from Space-borne Lidar in the WRF-Chem Model for Air Quality Predictions in Northeast Asia
    </h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Using data from space-borne lidar as part of NASA’s Earth Observing System to change to dynamic values of canopy height in the WRF-Chem model. We predict that there will be a large difference with retrieved data, having more accurate canopy height represented in the model. Currently we are working to compile WRF-Chem with the new canopy height dataset. </p>

     Analysis on the Effect of Students’ Financial Contribution to Education on Class Attendance and Overall GPA
    </h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Analyzed whether there exists a correlation between whether if a student contributes financially to his/her tuition is dependent on financial aid, which would affect their tendency to skip class, and consequently their overall GPA. The data used for this study was obtained from an Emory Economics class survey of 108 students.  </p>
